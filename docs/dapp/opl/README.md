# Oasis Privacy Layer

The Oasis Privacy Layer (OPL) is an EVM-compatible privacy solution that opens
new frontiers for confidential smart contracts in Web3 applications on the
most popular EVM networks like Ethereum, BNB Chain, and Polygon.

## DApp Development

The Oasis Privacy Layer contains a set of [smart contracts](https://github.com/oasisprotocol/sapphire-paratime/tree/main/contracts/contracts/opl)
for [Sapphire](../sapphire/README.mdx) to empower your existing and future Web3
applications with confidentiality.

Application developers on any EVM-compatible network can add confidential state
and selective disclosures to their applications through the usage of a smart
contract deployed on OPL without leaving their existing networks.

For more information about OPL and to catch the latest news, please visit the
