# Getting Started

## General Resources

These guides provide overview of the Oasis Network and introduce basic tools
for you to get started.

    findSidebarItem('/general/oasis-network/'),
    findSidebarItem('/general/manage-tokens/'),
    findSidebarItem('/general/contribute-to-the-network'),
]} />

## Node Operators

If you want to run your own Oasis node, the following section will provide you
with guides on how to set up your node, let it be a validator node, perhaps
running a ParaTime or just a simple client node for your server to submit
transactions and perform queries on the network.

## Developers

This section is focused on developers building applications on top of the Oasis
Network. Smart contract developers will be interested in the EVM-compatible
Emerald and confidential Sapphire ParaTimes. For maximum security and
confidentiality, the Oasis team designed a novel Cipher ParaTime executing Wasm
smart contracts and allows you to develop smart contracts in Rust using the
Oasis SDK. Finally, developers can learn how to build their own ParaTime
running on the Oasis Network.

## Oasis Core Contributors

Whether you want to contribute your code to the core components of the Oasis
Network or just learn more about the Oasis core, this is the place for you.
