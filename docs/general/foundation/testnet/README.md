# The Testnet

:::danger

**The Testnet may be subject to frequent version upgrades and state resets.**

:::

:::info

On the Testnet, TEST tokens are in use -- if you need some to test your clients, nodes or paratimes, feel free to request them on [**#testnet** in the Community Slack](../../oasis-network/connect-with-us). Note that these are test-only tokens and account balances, as any other state, may be frequently reset.
