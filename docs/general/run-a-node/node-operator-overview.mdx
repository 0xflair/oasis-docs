# Overview

[Oasis Network](../oasis-network/overview.md)'s Consensus Layer is a decentralised set of validator nodes that maintain a proof-of-stake blockchain. The nodes are operated by independent node operators.

This documentation is intended to assist any individual or organization in participating in the network as a node operator.
